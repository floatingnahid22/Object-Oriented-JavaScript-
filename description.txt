Class methods are created with the same syntax as object methods. 
Use the keyword class to create a class. A JavaScript class is not

Giving example like "User", created a class named "User". The class 
has three initial properties like:"email" , "name" and "status".

1. ceates a new empty object ()
2. sets the value of "this" to be the new empty object
3. calls the constructor method.
